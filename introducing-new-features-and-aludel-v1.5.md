## 1. Using your Crucible as a Smart Wallet/Vault

We've now made it easier for you to manage assets by using your Crucible via [crucible.alchemist.wtf](https://crucible.alchemist.wtf)

You can easily transfer ERC20 tokens in and out of your Crucible and use your Crucible as a Vault.

This also means moving around your assets is much easier as you can easily transfer a Crucible full of tokens to another wallet with a single transaction.

### Viewing your Crucible Contents

You can now view your "Locked assets" and "Unlocked assets" in a simple form.  **Locked assets** are tokens that have been subscribed to a reward program. **Unlocked Assets** are tokens sitting in your Crucible that are not subscribed to any program and are free to be transferred.   ![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-23-at-23.59.42.png)

## 3. Claiming rewards and Unsubscribing from a reward program

7. Click 'Claim rewards and unsubscribe' and follow the wallet signing requests to claim your rewards.

## 4. Taking part in the new Aludel v1.5

There is no correct way to do this next step.

You may already be subscribed to the old program. You do not have to claim your rewards and unsubscribe from it to join the new program but you might find it be better to do so as Inflation is no longer being paid into the program. To unsubscribe from the old Aludel, please follow [part 3 above](crucible/guides-crucible.alchemist.wtf/introducing-new-features-and-aludel-v1.5.md#3-claiming-rewards-and-unsubscribing-from-a-reward-program).

{% hint style="info" %}
There is a possibility that your reward value may change while remaining in the old Aludel after 23/06/2021.
