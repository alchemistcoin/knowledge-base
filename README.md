# About Alchemist

Alchemist was started with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/thegostep/status/1358159173440184322?s=20) by [@thegostep](https://twitter.com/thegostep).

There is no “dev team”. There is no company. There is only a community of Alchemists figuring out what to build in the open.

There is no roadmap. An Alchemist never makes forward-looking statements, simply because the future is unpredictable.

Alchemist is a community driven builders hub and[ Incubator](https://docs.alchemist.wtf/alchemist/the-alchemist-fractal/builders-program), working with like minded developers to finance, incubate and empower small agile teams; building products that promote a fairer and more transparent crypto ecosystem whilst growing the Alchemist community.

Some popular Alchemist projects include [Copper](https://docs.alchemist.wtf/copper), the platform for open, transparent, and user-friendly participation in Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools, [mistX](https://docs.alchemist.wtf/mistx), the MEV protected exchange aggregator, and [Crucible](https://docs.alchemist.wtf/crucible), the smart contract, non-custodial, staking wallet and NFT.

## **How do I become an Alchemist?**

Becoming an Alchemist requires learning and practice. Training is a way of life for a true alchemist. There is no final destination, only continuous change.

⚗️ $MIST is used to coordinate and reward committed Alchemists. Whether you are an artist, a developer, a community manager, or a liquidity provider, there is a role for you.
