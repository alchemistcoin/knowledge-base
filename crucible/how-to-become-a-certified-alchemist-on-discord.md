If you own a Crucible, you can become a Certified Alchemist on our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/qWQQMMKjKe) üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚öó

If your Crucible was minted using the online site, please jump to [**Part 2**](how-to-become-a-certified-alchemist-on-discord.md#part-2)\*\*\*\*

If your Crucible was minted using [command line](https://github.com/alchemistcoin/alchemist), you need to log into a new MetaMask account using the mnemonics from your command line wallet. This is shown in [**Part 1**](how-to-become-a-certified-alchemist-on-discord.md#part-1)\*\*\*\*
