11. You will now get a pop up box from MetaMask asking you for a “Signature Request” click “sign”  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-05-07-at-13.11.35.png) 
12. Next you will get a transfer funds notification box from MetaMask as shown below. **We suggest you check the Gas Fee by clicking the EDIT button.  Some users have reported this defaulting to the slowest option, which can delay the completion of your transaction. If you are concerned the gas fees are too high, use** [**ethereumprice.org/gas/**](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/) **to help decide when the lowest gas fees might occur**

13. The transaction will now be sent to the TaiChi network. You will not be able to see this transaction on Etherscan straight away so don't panic! It will appear there once the transaction has gone through the TaiChi Network.
14. If you want to check that your transaction is going through on TaiChi you can paste the transaction hash into [taichi.network](https://taichi.network/) to see its progress.  **Note:** The TaiChi network will be a little slower than the ethereum network
15. Once the transaction has gone through and completed you will need to switch back to the ethereum network to view the Crucible
