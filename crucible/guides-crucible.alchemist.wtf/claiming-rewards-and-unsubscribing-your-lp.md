# תביעת תגמולים וביטול מנוי ה- LP שלך

At some point you may decided that you are ready to Claim your rewards and Unsubscribe your LP from your Crucible. 

The guide below is designed to step you through that process.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that when you unsubscribe all of your LP or only a portion of your LP from the crucible, the reward multiplier for the unsubscribed LP will be reset.  If you unsubscribe only a portion of the subscribed LP, the reward multiplier for the portion unsubscribed will be reset, while the subscribed portion will remain at its current multiplier. 

For example, suppose you have 1.7 LP subscribed and its reward multiplier is at 10x. You decide to unsubscribe 1 LP. The 0.7 LP remaining \(still subscribed\) will continue to have a reward multiplier of 10x, while the unsubscribed 1 LP's reward multiplier will be reset. 

The rewards you receive will be from the unsubscribed 1 LP, not the subscribed 0.7 LP.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that after claiming your rewards and unsubscribing your LP, you will no longer receive rewards from the Aludel reward program. To receive rewards again please follow the guide below, then withdraw your LP using the "Withdraw unsubscribed LP" button, and then subscribe your LP using the "Increase LP subscription" button.
