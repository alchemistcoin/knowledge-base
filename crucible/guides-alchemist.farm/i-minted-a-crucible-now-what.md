## You can check how many LP tokens are in your Crucible

Visit [alchemist.farm](https://alchemist.farm/) and connect your wallet and click on the Crucibles tab.

The Total Balance reflects your Crucible LP value.

As you can see it also displays several other useful metrics to track the performance.

## How do I know if I've subscribed the LP within my Crucible?

It should be done automatically. You can also use [alchemist.farm](https://alchemist.farm/) to check on your Crucible. There will be a padlock icon in the upper right corner of the Crucible display which indicates the amount of LP that has been subscribed to the Aludel reward program: ![](https://i.imgur.com/ed4d3m8.png)

## How do I check my Aludel rewards?

You can use [alchemist.farm](https://alchemist.farm/) to display your Crucibles, where it will list your current ⚗️ and ETH rewards.

## If I've minted my Crucible and subscribed my LP... is that it?

Yes. Now you sit back and see what happens.
