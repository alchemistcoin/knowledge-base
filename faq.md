# FAQ

## **Where can I trade ⚗️ \($MIST\) ?**

Most activity happens on Uniswap, you can find it using our link

* [uniswap.alchemist.wtf](http://uniswap.alchemist.wtf)

Over time $MIST is bound to appear on other trading sites, when this happens these places can be identified by using [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alchemist) or [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/alchemist/).

## **What is total/circulating supply?**

Circulating supply and total supply are the same. This started with 1,000,000, but increases by 1% every two weeks. The current supply is shown [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x88acdd2a6425c3faae4bc9650fd7e27e0bebb7ab)

## **Do you plan pre/private/public sale?**

There are no sales. We held an initial Balancer pool and all ETH raised were deposited into the reward program.

## **Does the token have inflation?**

Inflation is currently 1% every two weeks but can be modified up or down. To avoid being diluted by inflation, Subscribe your ⚗️$MIST in the Aludel reward program.

The current allocation of the inflation tokens is:

50% to Aludel reward pool, 25% to $MIST community multisig & 25% to $MIST treasury.

## **What can I do with my ⚗️$MIST?**

A liquidity provider reward program has been deployed for the ⚗️$MIST/ETH Uniswap pool. This reward program is called the Aludel. \(Think of this as a staking smart contract designed by our guildmaster\).

A community multisig has been created to accumulate funds that can be used for bounties. Take a look at the [\#builders-application](https://discord.gg/92hQDCw25u) on discord or donate to the multisig at [multisig.alchemistcoin.eth.](https://etherscan.io/address/multisig.alchemistcoin.eth)
