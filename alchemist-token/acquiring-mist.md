# Acquiring $MIST ⚗️

### &#x20;Getting $MIST ⚗️

Ever traded coins on mistX.io? If so you know how to do this already.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend using mistX.io when trading $MIST. However, if you decide to use Uniswap, please note that due to low liquidity on **Uniswap V3**, extra slippage might mean you will not get the best price for your purchase. Please use this [**Uniswap V2**](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x88acdd2a6425c3faae4bc9650fd7e27e0bebb7ab\&use=V2) **** link to perform the token swap using Uniswap.
{% endhint %}

1. Head to [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x88acdd2a6425c3faae4bc9650fd7e27e0bebb7ab\&use=V2\&chain=mainnet)
2. Connect MetaMask wallet
3. You should see something like this:\

5. Hit "Swap", make necessary approvals via MetaMask, wait for the transaction to complete
   * mistX has the ability to let you increase the success rate of a transaction by clicking the Setting icon and choosing to pay a higher transaction fee.
